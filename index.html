              "The PlayStation 5 (PS5) was announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4 and then released in November 2020, however, 
              due to chip shortages and the Covid-19 pandemic, owning one almost two years later is still a hassle.
              The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, 
              which were released in the same month.

              The PlayStation 5’s main hardware features include a solid-state drive (SSD) customized for high-speed data streaming to 
              enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, 
              hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. 
              Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and 
              PlayStation VR games."

            <h2>Popup Ads on Android TV!</h2>

            <p>Tech is getting really good, buying a TV now means being set for a decade or more without needing to upgrade, 
              with future-proof 8K TVs and crazy fast interfaces, TV manufacturers have to make sure they find another way to eat apart from selling hardware.
              <br>
              <br>
              Part of the reason the Apple ecosystem is so reliable albeit expensive is software, every hardware manufacturer is moving in this direction, 
              from subscription services to cloud services and you guessed it, ads.
              Smartphone manufacturers have been doing it, for instance, the cheaper Xiaomi smartphones get MIUI riddled with ads in the interface 
              to make up for the cheap price tag, now, TV manufacturers are following suit.</p>
